What Are Dental CBCT Scans? 
Dental CBCT Scans use a cone-shaped X-ray beam to create comprehensive 3D images of the teeth, jaw, sinuses, and other oral structures.

•	Dental implant planning. 
•	Orthodontic assessments. 
•	Diagnosis of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. 
•	Evaluation of root canals and dental trauma.
